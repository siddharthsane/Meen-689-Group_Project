The file 'SensorFusion.m' is the main file for Bayesian Filter.
It will require the following to run:
1)sensorlog_40.4m.mat (data from IMU, GPS)
2)Accelero_to_position.m (Function to convert acceleration to position, velocity)
3)Gps_to_bodyframe.m ( Function to convert GPS data to bodyframe)
4)BayesianEstimate.m ( Function to filter by Bayesian estimate)
Results:
1)Position in X and Y
2) Velocity in X and Y
